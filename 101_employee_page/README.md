# Employee page

Build a employee page to show and edit the employee info. Some inspirations:

1. [Stripe Home](https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-home)
2. [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/)
3. [read.cv](https://read.cv/)

# Instructions

You only need to build a single page to display a particular employee info and allow the employee to edit the page. But you still need to think about the routing, how people find a particular employee, how people find the department of an employee etc.

# Minimum Requirements

1. A UI to display the employee info.
2. Support changing the employee info.

The requirements are intentionally simple and vague, please think a bit further about what you expect the user to view and edit the employee info.

# Good to have

### Tech Stack

We don't enforce the tech stack in the assignment, but we recommend the tech stack used in our main product. since that's the one you will work with after join. So you may try to get a sense beforehand.

1. Frontend - TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS.
2. Backend - Next.JS. It's also totally fine if your solution doesn't involve backend at all.

### Features

We don't require any additional features. If you have more time, we recommend you to polish those minimum requirements. But if you can't resist the temptation, just go ahead and surprise us.
