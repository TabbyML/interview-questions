  # Q&A Website

Build a Q&A Website, similar examples:
1. https://stackoverflow.com
2. https://quora.com


# Instructions

You only need to build an interface to reproduce the individual question page (e.g https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35198208/handling-cancelled-request-with-express-node-js-and-angular).

We do **NOT** require you to build a real Q&A website, so backend is not needed in this assignment.

# Minimum Requirements

1. Allow user to upvote / downvote the question and the answer.
2. Allow user to sort the answer by different metrics (e.g highest score, updated time)

The requirements are relatively simple. On the other hand, please put more thought on the overall design and leave space for the future improvement.

# Good to have

### Tech Stack

We don't enforce the tech stack in the assignment, but we recommend the tech stack used in our main product since that's the one you will work with after join. So you may try to get a sense beforehand.

> TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS.

### Features

We don't require any additional features. If you have more time, we recommend you to polish those minimum requirements. But if you can't resist the temptation, just go ahead and surprise us.

# Deliverables
