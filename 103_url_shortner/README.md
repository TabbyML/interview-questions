# URL shortener

Build a URL shortener service, similar examples:

1. [bitly](https://bitly.com/)

# Instructions

You only need to build an interface to support 2 features:

1. Allow user to convert a full URL to a shortened URL.
2. Allow user to convert the shortened URL to the original URL.
3. Allow user to create a customized shortern URL.

We do **NOT** require you to build a real URL shortener service where the browser will redirect the shortened URL to the original full URL.

# Minimum Requirements

A UI allowing user to convert a full URL to a shortened URL and vice versa.

The requirements are relatively simple. On the other hand, please put more thought on the overall design and leave space for the future improvement.

# Good to have

### Tech Stack

We don't enforce the tech stack in the assignment, but we recommend the tech stack used in our main product since that's the one you will work with after join. So you may try to get a sense beforehand.

1. Frontend - TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS.
2. Backend - Next.JS

### Features

We don't require any additional features. If you have more time, we recommend you to polish those minimum requirements. But if you can't resist the temptation, just go ahead and surprise us.
