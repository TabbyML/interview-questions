# Take-home interview assignment

This is the home for [TabbyML](https://www.tabbyml.com) take-home interview assignment. Each subfolder contains an individual assignment. During our interview process, we will give candidate one of these assignments and let her/him work on it for a week offline. Our followup technical interview will discuss the various aspects about the solution the candidate built.


# FAQ

_Q: Are you worrying about candidate preparing the problem in advance to gain an edge?_

A: Nope. One can only prepare for couple weeks, but we are evaluating candidate's years of accumulation.

_Q: I have new ideas, suggestions._

A: Opening new issue, creating PR. We will respond in a timely fashion. Thanks in advance.
